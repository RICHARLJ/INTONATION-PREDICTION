# Intonation-Prediction
The mini-project consists of two components:

Basic solution : Using the MLEnd dataset, build a model that predicts the intonation of a short audio segment.

Advanced solution :Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd dataset and build a solution model to identify a numeral in a short sequence
